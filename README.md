# Rocket/Yew Starter Pack

Rocket is a framework for building web servers in Rust, with a routing API that
feels like Flask (Python). Yew is a frontend framework for writing front end
apps in Rust using cutting-edge (but well-supported) WebAssembly technologies,
and with an API inspired by patterns from Elm and React.
