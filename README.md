# Rocket/Yew Starter Pack

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress. I'll probably post it to Reddit when it's done.

Rocket is a framework for building web servers in Rust, with a routing API that
feels like Flask (Python). Yew is a frontend framework for writing front end
apps in Rust using cutting-edge (but well-supported) WebAssembly technologies,
and with an API inspired by patterns from Elm and React.
